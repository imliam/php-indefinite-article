Determine the indefinite article of an English term.

An indefinite article is the word that comes before nouns or noun equivalents in English, such as "_a_" or "_an_". If the word starts with a consonant sound, the article used should be "_a_" — for example "banana" becomes "_a_ banana". If the word starts with a vowel sound, the article used should be "_an_" — for example "apple" becomes "_an_ apple".

This is not as simple as checking whether the first character of the word is a vowel or consonant as that does not determine the sound pronounced when speaking the word.

This is a port of [Eamon Nerbonne's original solution](https://github.com/EamonNerbonne/a-vs-an) for the problem.
